# House of Possession
Short survival/horror/text adventure game written in C++

Game loop inspired by classic survival/horror games such as Haunted House for the Atari 2600, Alone in the Dark for DOS Windows PC, and Resident Evil for the Playstation, as well as more modern games such as Amnesia: the Dark Descent.

## Story

You play as Jonathan Drawde, a young professor who has recently been informed that he has inherited a mansion from his long-lost and recently deceased aunt Emily Greyhart. Jonathan arrives at the mansion to claim the deed, but as he steps inside... the door mysteriously locks behinds him. 

Unbeknownst to Jonathan, Ms. Greyhart was an obsessive collector of all manner of trinkets and objects, and now her ghost has been bound to the mortal world- unable to part from her prized belongings. Now she seeks to defend her home from trespassers, and Jonathan must find a way to escape before she steals his soul and adds it to her collection of possessions.

## Gameplay

Jonathan must hurry and find the **three keys** to unlock the front door... *if* he is to escape with his soul intact. As the game progresses, the full moon will rise higher and higher, increasing Ms. Greyhardt's other-worldly powers. Watch out as she begins to move faster or becomes able to detect Jonathan nearby!

Ms. Greyhardt has the priority and will move first each turn, initially wandering the halls randomly- even phasing through rooms and walls- until she can find the intruder. If the player and Ms. Greyhardt both enter the same space during a single move, she will attack and steal a piece of Jonathan's soul! If this happens **three times, Jonathan will die** and his soul will be forever trapped as a part of Ms. Greyhardts collection of possessions.

To aid in his escape, Jonathan will have to utilize the **various trinkets and objects** scattered around the mansion. Even the most obscure items could have a use... but you will often have to *think outside the box.* Examining everything, reading descriptions, and gathering knowledge will also be key to your survival.
